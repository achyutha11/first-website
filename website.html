                <p class="para">I recently graduated from UChicago, where I majored in molecular engineering, and I'm currently working as a marketing analyst in Chicago
                    for a California-based startup.
                    I was born and brought up in the U.K, before moving to Bangalore with my family in 2012, where I went to middle school and high school.
                    I really like programming and ideally I'd like to use it to make some kind of positive difference through my career. A fun fact about me
                    is that during the pandemic, I became really obsessed with a YouTube channel about marble racing.

                <h2 class="para-heading">hobbies</h2>

                <p class="para">Music has always been a huge part of my life. I grew up singing Carnatic music and playing the violin, and
                    more recently, I was in the Ransom Notes, an all-gender a cappella group at UChicago. I still love to sing and play the violin whenever
                    I get the chance to. Apart from music, I follow football closely - I've been an Arsenal fan since I was six or seven years old.
                    When it's warm enough in Chicago (haha), I enjoy kicking a football around with my roommate on the pitch close to our apartment.

            <div class="para-grid">
                <h2 class="para-heading">what is this website?</h2>

                <p class="para">Currently, I'm going through the App Academy Open course as I try to get
                    better at coding, and one of the first projects is to build a website using HTML/CSS, so I figured I would use this opportunity to build out
                    a very basic personal website. The course has some requirements on this project, which should hopefully go some way towards explaining some of the other pages on this site.
                    It's my first attempt at building a website from scratch, and I'm definitely very far from being a natural at graphic design - don't take it too seriously!
