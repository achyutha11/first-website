            <h2 class="para-heading">Background</h2>

            <p class="para">I recently graduated from UChicago, where I majored in molecular engineering, and I'm currently working as a marketing analyst in Chicago,
                for a California-based startup.
                I was born and brought up in the U.K., before moving to Bangalore, with my family in 2012, where I attended middle school and high school.
                I really enjoy programming and I'm extremely keen to use it to make some kind of positive difference through my career. A fun fact about me
                is that during the pandemic, I became really obsessed with a YouTube channel about marble racing.

        <div class="para-grid" id="handi">
            <h2 class="para-heading">Hobbies and Interests</h2>

            <p class="para">Since I was really small, music has been a huge part of my life. I grew up singing Carnatic music and playing the Western violin, and
                more recently, I was a member of the Ransom Notes, an all-gender a cappella group at UChicago. I still love to sing and play the violin whenever
                I get the chance to. Apart from music, I follow football extremely closely - I've been an Arsenal fan since I was six or seven years old.
                When it's warm enough in Chicago, I enjoy kicking a football around with my roommate on the pitch close to our apartment.
            </p>

        <div class="para-grid">
            <h2 class="para-heading">Why did I make this website?</h2>

            <p class="para">I really enjoy programming! The parts of my molecular engineering degree that I enjoyed the most always involved coding. Eventually, I'd
                like to transition into a role that allows me to do more of that. Currently, I'm going through the App Academy Open course as I try to get
                better at coding, and one of the first projects is to build a website using HTML/CSS, so I figured I would use this opportunity to build out
                a basic profile website.
